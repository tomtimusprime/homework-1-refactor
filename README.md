Homework 1 - Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.
Your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.


Acceptance Requirements:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

USER STORY

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


My Thought Process:

As I completed this assignment I kept the following in mind:

-1.) Incorporate comments to both help with organizing the main sections, but to make it more readable and help anyone else looking at the code have a better understanding of what was changed and why.
-2.) Use semantic tags where possible in order to help with both SEO and readability.
-3.) Reduce redundant code in order to comply with the DRY standard of writing code and minimize inefficiency when rendering said code. 
-4.) Add, Commit and Push my code changes early and often in case of needing to roll back to previous versions and to help with understanding my thought processes as I adjusted the code.
-5.) I used https://w3schools.com, https://developer.mozilla.org/, and https://stackoverflow.com for reference when I needed a better understanding of a concept or particular property.
